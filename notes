THINGS TO DO BEFORE USING BOILERPLATE:

1.  Install node packages with "npm install" 
2.  start up the webpack dev server with "npn run serve"

AFTER FINISHING DEVELOPMENT:
1.  Run "npm build" to build deployment code

WEBPACK LOADERS:
*  "css loader" helps webpack collect css from a css file (runs first)
*  "style loader" takes that css and add it to the html page (runs last)
    (so whenever a css file is imported into a javascript file, webpack run that css
    through the loaders to add that css to the html page)
